# Testing

Windows checks used DuckStation **0.1-12083-g00e299795**, Vulkan at 5x with
both filters Nearest. Selected dialogue, menu, workshop and HUD scenes were
reviewed. Sixteen compact punctuation marks were checked in a controlled
renderer specimen: all 881,876 pixels outside the two text windows were
identical to the preceding pack. A normal HUD/menu frame was also unchanged
by that punctuation update. These checks apply to those scenes and settings.

The maintainer has used the expanded menu pack on **Android 0.1-8969** and
reported the PGXP problem and workaround. Device model and a hash-bound phone
capture were not recorded. Earlier dialogue ZIP import and rendering were
also confirmed on that build. This is limited testing, not all-device or
full-game certification.

The two unknown-value marks, NO. and save-time colon have reviewed source
proofs, but their normal game screens still need capture/testing. Rare glyphs,
some palette effects, title/save/name-entry screens and later-game usage need
broader coverage. Other regions and translations are not verified.
